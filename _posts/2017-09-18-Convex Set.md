## Convex Set hihi


* only difference between Affine and Convext Set is Affine is line 2D space vs Convex is line segment multi-D space

## Convex combination and convex hull

Convex Set: 2 points => a plane as $\theta$ varies

Convex Combination: k points (has to add up to 1) => a plane w many points on it => no longer a line segment but linear combination

Convex hull: shaded region of a plane of many points => for a point in convex hull => many combinations w different number of points of convex combinations could get to that point

Linear combination: doesn't need to added up to 1

$\theta$ like a mixture coefficient

Convex hull aka conv S: set of all convex combinations of points i.e. shaded region

## Hyperplane n Halfspace 

hyperplane is convex + affine
?? why halfspace is convex but not affine
