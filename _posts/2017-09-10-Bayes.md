# Bayes' rule in inference

## Amazon Rain Forest
Determining probability of a particular tribe having disease when you only see 3 people not having disease.

If he comes from a tribe that does not have disease => probability of him having disease = 0
else if he comes from tribe that has disease => probability = 0.5

IID: same tribe but not same family

$\theta$ = 1 means have disease

Factors affecting your judgment on probability:
1. probability of getting infected by the disease
2. probability of 



## Posterior

We are interested to learn probability of which tribe the 3 people come from given they all have no disease.

$P(\theta =1|data, model)$
i.e. given what we observe and what we choose as model

## Likelihood

Probability of coming from a tribe that has a disease, given 3 of them all not have disease.

$$P(data|\theta, model)$$(1)

When you see the data, you assume you did not see every part of the data. You assume there are parameters $\theta$ and some model that controls probability of data.

It is your subjective choice


## Prior
Prior denotes your previous belief about $\theta$. 
It is your subjective choice to manipulate the model despite the data seen.

Common choices include uniform, normal.

$$P(data|Model) = P(data|\theta,Model) * P(\theta|Model) & \text{Chain rule of conditional probability to integrate out}\theta$$

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule_(probability)

$P(A_4,A_3,A_2,A_1) = P(A_1)*P(A_2|A_1)*P(A_3|A_2,A_1)*P(A_4|A_3,A_2,A_1)$

Think of example of P(rain, umbrella, raincoats) as doing elimination in tables with columes equal to $A_4, A_3, A_2, A_1$


Integrating out raincoats means ignoring the requirement that raincoats have to be 1 in rows that already contains raincoats and umbrella being 1. $P(Raincoats|Umbrella)$ should be the answer since it looks at rows only when umbrellas are 1 and multiply by proportion of Raincoats being any value.


Think of this world as having a giant table containing columns of model, parameters and data with rows denoting all of their possible values.
